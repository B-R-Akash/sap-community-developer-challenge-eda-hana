# SAP Community Code Challenge Cloud Native - Challenges

 Every Wednesday of each week of the challenge you will get a new challenge added to this page.

 Every week you will get a new Jupyter notebook with the code that you must successfully execute. The code might be incorrect or incomplete, and it is a challenge for you to fix/complete the notebook and to share your successfully executed notebook.

Once you successfuly execute it completely, please share your result as a link to the saved Jupyter notebook or a screenshot of your completed notebook in the thread on SAP Community Group with the remard "Week 1". 

A link can be to that file in your public repository, or in a public share of your cloud storage (like OneDrive, DropBox, GDrive etc), or in a public notebook software (like CoLab, Binders etc).

 These challenges must be concluded and the submission fulfilled in order to have your submission count towards the month's total progression. Read the challenges for each week carefully.

**Enjoy learning something new! ðŸ˜Š** That's the most important!
